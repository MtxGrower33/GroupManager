# GroupManager

GroupManager is a WoW 1.12.1 addon that helps organize players into groups and automates recruitment tasks. It combines manual group management with automated features like scheduled invites, chat monitoring, and player searching.

## Features

### 1. Group Manager
Create and manage player groups with roles (Tank/Healer/DPS) and ratings. Add/remove players, switch between groups, and invite entire groups with one command.

### 2. Scheduler
Schedule group invites for specific times and dates. Set up weekly recurring events that automatically invite your saved groups at the scheduled time.

### 3. Chat Scanner
Monitor chat channels for specific keywords and automatically respond with whispers. Set custom keywords and auto-responses to recruit players mentioning dungeons or activities.

### 4. Who Scanner
Search for players by class and level range, then automatically whisper them recruitment messages. Players can reply 'inv' for instant auto-invite to your group.
